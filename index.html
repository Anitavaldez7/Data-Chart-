      <h1>Mott Haven gets green light to transform abandoned detox center into arts and education space</h1>

        <h2>For more than a decade, the Mott Haven community advocated for the reclamation of a building in the neighborhood so it could be turned into a community center focused on health, education and the arts. Their persistence paid off and today the space is back in their hands. </h2>

<p>Mott Haven, The Bronx.- What was once an abandoned government-owned detox center, is about to become a community epicenter known as the HEArts Community Center. Under the leadership of the nonprofit South Bronx Unite, the Mott Haven community is seeking funds to rebuild this space.</p> 

<p>After more than a decade of work and constant community campaigns in front of this building located on 140th Street, South Bronx Unite, through its community land trust Mott Haven-Port Morris Community Land Stewards, managed to recover this space driven by the need that in the community there was no center accessible to the general public and that served as a space for multiple organizations where youth, adults and seniors could participate in a variety of programs.</p>

<p>"We are creating a sustainable space for many groups that have served the community for a long time and do not have a place of their own," says Libertad O. Guerra, co-founder of South Bronx Unite and Mott Haven-Port Morris Community Land Trust board member.“The community center will serve as their headquarters.”</p>

<p>The acronym HEArts encompasses the three elements of health, education and arts that the new community center plans to focus on to serve the neighborhood. </p>

<p> The center comes also as a way to integrate youth into healthier and social activities after school. Mott Haven has a high rate of youth in K-12 and also high school graduates compared to New York City and the Bronx. </p>

<p> South Bronx Unite is in the final phase of the process to become a conditional developer and they estimate that the cost of the center will be approximately $40 million, of which $12 million is already covered because of the group being selected by the government. So far, they have been able to calculate the money needed it for the reconstruction of the space. Calculations are still in the process of buying furniture and equipment for the center.</p>

<p> From all the division's costs, most of the money goes to the replacement of windows and doors as well as the construction of a theatre. This space will be used by UpBeat NYC, the only community organization in Mott Haven that gives free music instruction to the kids and youth of the neighborhood.  </p>

<p>“The possibility that we could have a larger venue that could accommodate our large orchestras, including our Afro-Latin jazz band, is very exciting,” says Liza Austria, co-founder of UpBeat NYC.</p>

<p>We have a waiting list of over 75 families right now. So while we are thrilled to be able to serve 160 students, there are many more families we are trying to provide this service to, and the HEARts Center could potentially allow us to double what we are doing. That’s why we’re excited that this is becoming a reality,” she explains.</p>

<p>Previously, UpBeat NYC participated multiple times in HEArts festivals, which were events to galvanize the community to reclaim downtown.</p>

<p>“For me, it was very moving to see all the kids playing this beautiful music right in front of the building,” says Richard Miller, co-founder of UpBeat NYC. “And he was thinking, ‘Here they are outside the building, what would it be like if they could be inside?’ So for us it was like a visual representation of what it could be.”</p>
